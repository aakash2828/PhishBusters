# CYSE690-Team3 - InboxDefenders: Email Phishing Detection with Deep Learning

## Overview

Welcome to InboxDefenders, your ultimate solution for safeguarding against phishing attacks through advanced deep learning techniques. Our project aims to provide robust email security by effectively detecting phishing emails based on their content.

## About the Project

InboxDefenders is a cutting-edge email security project designed to combat phishing attacks using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. By leveraging Doc2Vec, LSTM, and Z-Score normalization, we've created a comprehensive solution capable of accurately identifying phishing emails by analyzing their semantic meaning, sequential data, and statistical patterns.

## Roadmap

Here's a glimpse of our project's roadmap:

Research and Development: Conduct in-depth research on phishing detection methodologies and explore various deep learning techniques.
Model Development: Implement Doc2Vec, LSTM, and Z-Score normalization to develop a robust phishing detection model.
Evaluation: Assess the model's effectiveness using confusion matrices and iteratively fine-tune parameters for optimal performance.
Integration: Seamlessly integrate InboxDefenders into existing email security systems to enhance protection against phishing attacks.
Community Engagement: Share insights and findings with the cybersecurity community and gather feedback for further improvement.

## How It Works

InboxDefenders harnesses the power of cutting-edge technologies such as Doc2Vec, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and Z-Score normalization to create a comprehensive phishing detection system:

Doc2Vec: Grasps semantic meaning and context within email content, enabling nuanced analysis that surpasses simple keyword matching.
LSTM: Manages sequential data and captures long-term dependencies, enhancing the model's ability to identify subtle patterns indicative of phishing behavior.
Z-Score Normalization: Preprocesses and standardizes data, ensuring consistency and enhancing model performance.

## Getting Started

To embark on your journey with InboxDefenders, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Obtain the source code from our repository.
Install Dependencies: Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.
Train the Model: Utilize your dataset to train the model.
Evaluate Performance: Assess the model's performance using confusion matrices.
Integration: Seamlessly integrate InboxDefenders into your email security system for heightened protection against phishing attacks.

## Evaluation

We evaluate the effectiveness of InboxDefenders using confusion matrices, which provide insights into the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This allows us to fine-tune parameters and optimize performance iteratively.
