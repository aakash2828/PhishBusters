InboxDefenders: Email Phishing Detection with Deep Learning
Overview
Welcome to InboxDefenders, an advanced email security project designed to protect users from phishing attacks using cutting-edge deep learning techniques. Our goal is to develop a robust system capable of accurately detecting phishing emails by analyzing their content.

How it Works
InboxDefenders leverages the power of Doc2Vec, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and Z-Score normalization to create a comprehensive solution for email phishing detection:

Doc2Vec: Captures the semantic meaning and context of email content, enabling nuanced analysis beyond simple keyword matching.
LSTM: Handles sequential data and captures long-term dependencies, enhancing the model's ability to identify patterns indicative of phishing behavior.
Z-Score Normalization: Preprocesses and standardizes data, ensuring consistency and improving model performance.
Evaluation
We evaluate the effectiveness of InboxDefenders using confusion matrices, which provide insights into the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This allows us to fine-tune parameters and optimize performance iteratively.

Getting Started
To get started with InboxDefenders:

Clone the repository.
Install the necessary dependencies.
Train the model using your dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance using confusion matrices.
Integrate InboxDefenders into your email security system for enhanced protection against phishing attacks.
